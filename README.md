# Steam ID checker
This tool can check if a Steam ID is taken or not. It is intended to work with bulk lists.

## Usage
The first time you open the tool, a new text file called "steamids" will appear in the path the program is stored. You can write the IDs into "steamids" while in the program menu.

To start checking, type "check". The tool will call "steamids" to read all the IDs.

Another file called "errorids" will appear to save the IDs that couldn't be checked due to an error. You can manually move them into "steamids" later to check them again.
